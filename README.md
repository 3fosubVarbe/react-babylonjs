> React BabylonJS is for integration of BabylonJS into a React or Redux project.

At this point more of a proof of concept, but I will be expanding and fixing as I have just started on a project for fun that integrates the technologies React, Redux and BabylonJs.  Will happily accept any pull requests as there is lots of room for extra functionality.

### Features

&nbsp; &nbsp; ✓ Redux middleware to intercept events.<br/>
