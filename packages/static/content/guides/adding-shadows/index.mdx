title: 'Adding Shadows'
---

There are a few ways to bring in shadows. The easiest way is to use
`shadowCastChildren` and have all child meshes (even models) automatically be
included as shadow casters

You'll need a floor/ground to have the shadows cast to that's easy it's just a
prop `allowShadows`. Oh yeah, and a light that is capable of casting shadows!

Note that you can use without `shadowCastChildren` with an inclusion/exclusion
list, etc or refs, etc.

Here is the imperative way:

```typescript
import { Color3, DirectionalLight, ShadowGenerator, MeshBuilder, StandardMaterial } from "@babylonjs/core";
// you need your scene instance
const box = MeshBuilder.CreateBox('box', { size: 2 }, scene);
box.position.y = 3; // so it is above ground to cast a shadow

const ground = MeshBuilder.CreateGround('ground', { width: 6, height: 6 }, scene);
ground.receiveShadows = true;

var light = new DirectionalLight("dl", new Vector3((-5 * Math.PI) / 4, (-5 * Math.PI) / 4, -Math.PI), scene);
light.position = {new Vector3(0, 4, 16);

var shadowGenerator = new ShadowGenerator(1024, light);
shadowGenerator.useBlurExponentialShadowMap = true;
shadowGenerator.useKernelBlur = true;
shadowGenerator.blurKernel = 64;
// this is what makes the box cast shadows
shadowGenerator.getShadowMap().renderList.push(box);
```

```tsx
<directionalLight
  name="dl"
  intensity={0.6}
  direction={new Vector3((-5 * Math.PI) / 4, (-5 * Math.PI) / 4, -Math.PI)}
  position={new Vector3(0, 4, 16)}
>
  <shadowGenerator mapSize={1024} useBlurExponentialShadowMap blurKernel={64} shadowCastChildren>
    <box name="box" size={2} />
  </shadowGenerator>
<directionalLight />
<ground name="ground" height={6} width={6} receiveShadows />
```

If you have followed on the previous guides then you hopefully were able to
follow all of that, but there are definitely a couple of points that need to be
explained!

1. ShadowGenerator will delay instantation until an appropriate light source
   (one that supports shadows) is available as a parent (any ancestor) element.
2. 'shadowCastChildren' is not a Babylon.js prop - it's a custom
   `react-babylonjs` one that takes all children elements that are meshes (even
   models) and adds/removes them from the shadowMap renderList as they are
   added/removed from the scene automatically.

Thanks for reading this far! That's it for the guide section so far. The
examples go into many specific use cases and highlight other `react-babylonjs`
custom props that are available and also highlight how to use other Babylon.js
components and integrate some 3rd party ones.
